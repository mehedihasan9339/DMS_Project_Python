# Cloning and Building the Python Project

Follow the steps below to clone a Python project from GitHub and build it on your local machine.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

To clone a GitHub repository, use the following command:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt**.
2. **Navigate to the directory** where you want to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/directory
   ```

3. **Clone the repository using the URL of the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
## Step 2: Navigate into the Project Folder

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repository
```
## Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It is a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a virtual environment** using the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
This command will create a new directory called venv in your project folder where the dependencies will be installed.

1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
